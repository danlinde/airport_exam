airport_exam
============

This was the Makers Academy test for Week 3 - Test-driven development and object-oriented programming.

I began this test by creating a domain model using CRC cards.

The test required that the resulting system modelled the following:

* A plane can land if cleared to land
* A plane can take off if cleared to take off
* A plane cannot take off in bad weather or if there is a bomb scare

* An airport has a collection of planes
* An airport has a maximum capacity for planes
* An airport has weather conditions
* An airport can have a bomb scare
* An airport can call off a bomb scare
* An airport can clear a plane for takeoffs and landings

In addition, I completed the following stretch goals:

* An airport has a runway to be used for take off
* A plane must request permission to take off from an air traffic controller
* A plane has a crew
